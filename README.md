# NEWBOX-SETUP

This is a collection of utility scripts designed or at least useful for setting up a new development environment.

### link-bin-to-scripts [USERNAME]
Takes all the scripts in my /scripts folder and creates symlinks in /bin for them. Allows me to use them from /bin while still keeping them source-controlled via git.
